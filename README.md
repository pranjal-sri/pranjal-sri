Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning, neural networks, and all things programming. 
Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning. I like working LLMs, CUDA and distributed Machine Learning.

### Favorite Projects

- **[Inference optimisation of Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/RishabhS66/Inference-Acceleration-of-Stable-Diffusion):** How can we make image generation with Stable diffusion faster? This project explores techniques like Pruning and quantisation for inference optimisation. We also implement a custom timestep calibrated quantisation technique which improves the performance of Post Quantisation significantly with diffusion. 
  
- **[Video Super resolution with SRGANs and PyTorch](https://github.com/pranjal-sri/Controlled_VSR):** Training end-to-end video models for video upsclaing is pretty expensive. But can we adapt an already capable image super-resolution model for videos? This project does so with the help of Optical flow and control nets to incorporate temporal information in individual frames.
  
- **[Collision Simulator](https://github.com/pranjal-sri/Collision-Simulator):** The internals of simulation systems and animation has always been fascinating to me. This project is a from-scratch implementation of a system of particles with event-driven simulation. It is written with Java Swing and can depict various phenomena like Brownian-motion, diffusion, pendulum and any other system with elastic collisions that you can initialise!
